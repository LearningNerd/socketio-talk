FIRST: How do I uninstall NodeJS on my laptop??

## Intro Section

Hello, my fellow curious coders! My name is Liz Krane, and although I'm just a disembodied voice at the moment, you might know me from Learn to Code LA, the meetup group I started in 2015.

If you're attending or following along with our workshop, currently titled "...", then this video is for you! I'm going to walk you through everything you need to do to get set up for the workshop.

Now, this video is a work-in-progress, so it might be replaced with a new version, which you'll find at LEARNTOCODELA.ORG/****
Definitely bookmark that page, because that's where you'll find everything related to this workshop.

First an important note: before you do anything else, it's always a good idea to backup your computer!
Do backups on a regular basis, *and* before embarking on any new technological adventures like if you're installing new software on your computer

So, that's my little disclaimer: chances are nothing will go wrong, but if it does... uh, just don't sue me, haha.
