	<h2 style="margin-bottom:40px;">So the only limit is your imagination!</h2>

	<p>With just those few SocketIO functions and some client-side JavaScript,
		 you can create <em>any and every</em> type of real-time, multi-user interaction.</p>
</section>

<section data-state="boxmaster">
	<h2 style="margin-bottom:60px;">Here's a super basic example</h2>
	<p style="margin-bottom:60px;">I wrote some client-side JavaScript to move a box around the screen...</p>
	<p>Then I used SocketIO to let me broadcast it to all of you!</p>
</section>

<section data-state="boxshared">
	<h2 style="margin-bottom:60px;">Now <strong>press <span class="highlighted-blue">W</span>, <span class="highlighted-blue">A</span>, <span class="highlighted-blue">S</span>, and <span class="highlighted-blue">D</span></strong> on your keyboard to move the box!</h2>
	<p style="margin-bottom:60px;">Here we're all controlling the same box at the same time, just like in<br> <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pok%C3%A9mon">Twitch Plays Pokemon</a> (check that out later if you haven't seen it!)</p>
	<p>Just one small change in my code produced this very different interaction. Cool, huh?</p>
</section>

<section data-state="boxindividual">
	<h2 style="margin-bottom:60px;">Now let's try a third variation</h2>
	<p style="margin-bottom:60px;">Everyone has a box of their own to move around the screen!</p>
	<p><em>OK, I know, it's not that exciting.<br> But imagine this as the first step towards making a multiplayer game!</em></p>
